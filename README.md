Lotus Explorer - 2.4.7
================

Lotus block explorer written in TypeScript for node.js

See it live: https://explorer.givelotus.org

### Requires

*  node.js >= 16.14.1
*  mongodb 4.2.x
*  lotusd (latest version)

### Create database

Enter MongoDB cli:

    $ mongo

Create databse:

    > use explorerdb

Create user with read/write access:

    > db.createUser( { user: "username", pwd: "password", roles: [ "readWrite" ] } )

*Note: If you're using mongo shell 4.2.x, use `db.addUser` instead of `db.createUser`

### Get the source

    git clone https://github.com/maff1989/lotus-explorer

### Install node modules

    cd lotus-explorer && npm install --production

### Configure

    cp ./settings.json.template ./settings.json

*Make required changes in settings.json*

### Start Explorer

    npm start

**Note**: mongod must be running to start the explorer

As of Iquidus version 1.4.0 the explorer defaults to cluster mode, forking an instance of its process to each cpu core. This results in increased performance and stability. Load balancing is handled automatically and any instances that die will be restarted. For testing/development (or if you just wish to) a single instance can be launched with

    node --stack-size=10000 bin/instance.js

To stop the cluster you can use

    npm stop

### Syncing databases with the blockchain

sync.js (located in scripts/) is used for updating the local databases. This script must be called from the explorer's root directory.

    Usage: node scripts/sync.js [database] [mode]

    database: (required)
    index [mode] Main index: coin info/stats, transactions & addresses
    market       Market data: summaries, orderbooks, trade history & chartdata

    mode: (required for index database only)
    update       Updates index from last sync to current block
    reindex      Clears index then resyncs from genesis to current block

    notes:
    * 'current block' is the latest created block when script is executed.
    * The market database only supports (& defaults to) reindex mode.

**ZMQ**

It is recommended to use the ZeroMQ on your lotusd in order to detect and process new blocks. A PHP script for ZMQ is included in the repo. To launch the script, navigate to the Explorer's top-level directory and run:

    php scripts/zmq.php

**Note**: You must have the `php-zmq` module installed on your system in order for this to work. Refer to the PHP documentation for instructions on how to install on your system.

### Node

Lotus Explorer is intended to be generic, so it can be used with any wallet following the usual standards. The node must be running with atleast the following flags

    -daemon -txindex

It is also heavily advised against running lotusd with the wallet functionality enabled. In order to disable, add the following line to your `~/.lotus/lotus.conf` file:

    disablewallet = 1
    
### Security

Ensure mongodb is not exposed to the outside world via your mongo config or a firewall to prevent outside tampering of the indexed chain data. 

### Known Issues

**script is already running.**

If you receive this message when launching the sync script either a) a sync is currently in progress, or b) a previous sync was killed before it completed. If you are certian a sync is not in progress remove the index.pid from the tmp folder in the explorer root directory.

    rm tmp/index.pid

**exceeding stack size**

    RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

Nodes default stack size may be too small to index addresses with many tx's. If you experience the above error while running sync.js the stack size needs to be increased.

To determine the default setting run

    node --v8-options | grep -B0 -A1 stack_size

To run sync.js with a larger stack size launch with

    node --stack-size=[SIZE] scripts/sync.js index update

Where [SIZE] is an integer higher than the default.

*note: SIZE will depend on which blockchain you are using, you may need to play around a bit to find an optimal setting*
